Update variables in ./group_vars/all to add/remove packages and other elements to the server's installation

Update the hosts file to reference the servers you will want to be updated.  If you've defined them in your ~/.ssh/config file you can use those names, otherwise you will need to use the server's dns or ip address.

run:  ansible-playbook ./playbook_base.yml  in root of directory to apply roles/tasks
